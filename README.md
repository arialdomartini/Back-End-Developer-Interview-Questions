Back-End Developer Interview Questions
======================================

This page has been translated to [Chinese](https://github.com/monklof/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions) by [monklof](https://github.com/monklof).

I started writing down this list as a personal reminder of topics I had the chance to discuss with colleagues and friends, and that I wanted to deepen...

I'm not a big fan of asking technical questions in job interviews: I rather prefer to sit together with candidates in front of some real code, hands on the keyboard, facing a real problem, and have a full day of pair programming, hopefully rotating with all the other team members. Yet, I feel some technical questions could be a good starting point to begin an engaging and nice conversation, and this can be useful to get a deeper knowledge of each others.

This repo collects a number of back end related questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question on the same candidate: that would take hours, and would have no sense at all, as they cover a too broad set of topics for a single developer's to possibly know. Browse the section you find more relevant for your context, and pick the questions that give you more ideas on the conversation to have.

### Notice
Most of the questions are open-ended, and some of them just don't have a *right* or a *wrong* answer. On the contrary, they are intended to be used as the starting point for a conversation that hopefully tells you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would. Personally, I would even choose the questions whose answers are not yet clear to me.

Again, I stress that just asking questions is hardly sufficient. Complete the interview with a long pair programming session with your candidates: it is one of the best opportunities to know each others' style and approach and to let candidates know some details about their future day job.

This project is admittedly inspired by [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) by [@darcyclarke](https://github.com/darcyclarke)



### Where are the answers?

Sooner or later I will complete it with the relative answers. Feel free to contribute, it would be highly appreciated!

### [[↑]](#toc) <a name='patterns'>Questions about Design Patterns:</a>

* Why are global and static objects evil? Can you show it with a code example?
* Tell me about Inversion of Control and how it improves the design of code.
* The Law of Demeter (the Principle of Least Knowledge) states that each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units and it should only talk to its immediate friends (sometimes stated as "don't talk to strangers"). Would you write code violating this principle, show why it is a bad design and then fix it?
* Active-Record is the design pattern that promotes objects to include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, and properties that correspond to the columns in some underlying database table. In your opinion and experience, which are the limits and pitfalls of the this pattern?
* Data-Mapper is a design pattern that promotes the use of a layer of Mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself. On the contrary, in Active-Record objects directly incorporate operations for persisting themselves to a database, and properties corresponding to the underlying database tables. Do you have an opinion on those patterns? When would you use one instead of the other?
* Why is it often said that the introduction of `null` is a "billion dollar mistake"? Would you discuss the techniques to avoid it, such as the Null Object Pattern introduced by the GOF book, or Option types?
* Many state that, in Object-Oriented Programming, composition is often a better option than inheritance. What's you opinion?
* What is an Anti-corruption Layer?
* Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single object. Writing a Thread-Safe Singleton class is not so obvious. Would you try?
* The ability to change implementation without affecting clients is called Data Abstraction. Produce an example violating this property, then fix it.
* Write a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, fix it.
* How would you deal with Dependency Hell?
* Is goto evil? You may have heard of the famous paper "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" by Edsger Dijkstra, in which he criticized the use of the `goto` statement and advocated structured programming instead. The use of `goto` has always been controversial, so much that even Dijkstra's letter was criticized with articles such as "'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered Harmful". What's your opinion on the use of `goto`?
* The robustness principle is a general design guideline for software that recommends "*be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept*". It is often reworded as "*be a tolerant reader and a careful writer*". Would you like to discuss the rationale of this principle?
* Separation of Concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct areas, each one addressing a separate concern. There are a lot of different mechanisms for achieving Separation of Concerns (use of objects, functions, modules, or patterns such as MVC and the like). Would you discuss this topic?


### [[↑]](#toc) <a name='design'>Questions about Code Design:</a>

* It is often said that one of the most important goals in Object-Oriented Design (and code design in general) is to have High Cohesion and Loose Coupling. What does it mean? Why is it that important and how is it achieved?
* Why do array indexes start with '0' in most languages?
* How do tests and TDD influence code design?
* Write a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, explain why it is a bad design, and fix it.
* What's the difference between cohesion and coupling?
* What is refactoring useful for?
* Are comments in code useful? Some say they should be avoided as much as possible, and hopefully made unnecessary. Do you agree?
* What is the difference between design and architecture?
* In TDD, why are tests written before code?
* C++ supports multiple inheritance, and Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. What impact does using these facilities have on orthogonality? Is there a difference in impact between using multiple inheritance and multiple interfaces? Is there a difference between using delegation and using inheritance? [This question is from The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas]
* What are the pros and cons of holding domain logic in Stored Procedures?
* In your opinion, why has Object-Oriented Design dominated the market for so many years?

* Show me an example where an anonymous function can be useful.
* There are a lot of different type systems. Let's talk about static and dynamic type systems, and about strong and weak ones. You surely have an opinion and a preference about this topic. Would you like to share them, and discuss why and when would you promote one particular type system for developing an enterprise software?
* What are namespaces useful for? Invent an alternative.
* Talk about interoperability between Java and C# (in alternative, choose 2 other arbitrary languages)

* What is a stack and what is a heap? What's a stack overflow?
* Why is it important that in a language functions are first class citizens?
* Some languages, especially the ones that promote a functional approach, allow a technique called pattern matching. Do you know it? How is pattern matching different from switch clauses?
* Why do some languages have no exceptions by design? What are the pros and cons?
* If `Cat` is an `Animal`, is `TakeCare<Cat>` a `TakeCare<Animal>`?
* In Java, C# and many other languages, why are constructors not part of the interface?
* In the last years there has been a lot of hype around Node.js. What's your opinion on using a language that was initially conceived to run in the browser in the backend?
* Pretend you have a time machine and pretend that you have the opportunity to go to a particular point in time during Java's (or C#, Python, Go or whatever) history, and talk with some of the JDK architects. What would you try to convince them of? Removing checked exceptions? Adding unsigned primitives? Adding multiple-inheritance?

* How is lazy loading achieved? When is it useful? What are its pitfalls?
* The so called "N + 1 problem" is an issue that occurs when code needs to load the children of a parent-child relationship with a ORMs that have lazy-loading enabled, and that therefore issue a query for the parent record, and then one query for each child record. How to fix it?
* How would you find the most expensive queries in an application?
* In your opinion, is it always needed to use database normalization? When is it advisable to use denormalized databases?
* Of of the Continuous Integration's techniques is called Blue-Green Deployment: it consists in having two production environments, as identical as possible, and in performing the deployment in one of them while the other one is still operating, and than in safely switching the traffic to the second one after some convenient testing. This technique becomes more complicated when the deployment includes changes to the database structure or content. I'd like to discuss this topic with you.

* What is CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)? How is it different from the oldest Command-Query Separation Principle?
* The so called "multitier architecture" is an approach to design a client–server system aimed to keep physically and logically separated presentation, application processing, data management and other functions. The most widespread of the multitier architectures is the three-tier architecture. Would you discuss the pros and cons of such an approach?
* How would you design a software system for scalability?
* Someone gave the name "The "C10k problem" to the problem of optimising network sockets to handle over 10.000 open connections at once. While handling 10.000 concurrent clients is not the same as handling 10.000 open connection, the context is similar. It's a tough challenge anyway, and no one is expected to know every single detail to solve it. It may be interesting to discuss the strategies you know to deal with that problem. Would you like to try?
* How would you design a decentralized (that is, with no central server) P2P system?
* You may recall that Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs (CGI scripts) that execute as Command-line programs on a server, and that dynamically generate HTML pages when invoked by a HTTP request. Perl and PHP used to be common languages for such scripts. In CGI, a HTTP request generally causes the invocation of a new process on the server, but FastCGI, SCGI and other approaches improved the mechanism, raising the performance, with techniques such as preforking processes. Can you discuss why CGI became obsolete, and was instead replaced with other architectural approaches?

      });
  }
}
```

* About Type Erasure, what's the output of this Java snippet, and why?
```java
ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<Integer>();
ArrayList<Float> lf = new ArrayList<Float>();
if (li.getClass() == lf.getClass()) // evaluates to true
  System.out.println("Equal");
```


* Can you spot the memory leak?
```java
public class Stack {
    private Object[] elements;
    private int size = 0;
    private static final int DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY = 16;

    public Stack() {
        elements = new Object[DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY];
    }

    public void push(Object e) {
        ensureCapacity();
        elements[size++] = e;
    }

    public Object pop() {
        if (size == 0)
            throw new EmptyStackException();
        return elements[--size];

     * Ensure space for at least one more element, roughly
     * doubling the capacity each time the array needs to grow.
     */
    private void ensureCapacity() {
        if (elements.length == size)
            elements = Arrays.copyOf(elements, 2 * size + 1);

        case "FAIL":
            return "error";
        case "OK":
            return String.format("%s%s", theInput, theInput);
        default:
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```


* Can you get rid of these `if`s and make this snippet of code more object oriented?

```java
public class TheService {
    private final FileHandler fileHandler;
    private final FooRepository fooRepository;

    public TheService(FileHandler fileHandler, FooRepository fooRepository) {
        this.fileHandler = fileHandler;

        if (executionId.equals("") || rewrittenUrl.equals("")) {
            return "";
        }

        Foo knownFoo = fooRepository.getFooByXmlFileName(rewrittenUrl);

                }
                else

        }
        else
        {
            error = OPERATION2FAILED;
