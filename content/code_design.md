## Questions about Code Design

* It is often heard that one of the most important goals in Object-Oriented Design (and code design in general) is to have High Cohesion and Loose Coupling. What does it mean? Why is it that important and how is it achieved?
* Why does array index start with '0' in most of languages?
* How do tests and TDD influence code design?
* Write a snippet of code violating the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, explain why is it a bad design, and fix it.
* What's the difference between cohesion and coupling?
* What is refactoring useful for?
* Are comments in code useful? Some say they should be avoided as much as possible, and hopefully made unnecessary. Do you agree?
* What is the difference between design and architecture?
* Why in TDD are tests written before code?
* C++ supports multiple inheritance, and Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. What impact does using these facilities have on orthogonality? Is there a difference in impact between using multiple inheritance and multiple interfaces? Is there a difference between using delegation and using inheritance? [This question is from The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas]
* Pros and cons of holding domain logic in Stored Procedures.
* In your opinion, why have Object-Oriented Design dominated the market for so many years?
* What would you do to understand if your code has a bad design?
