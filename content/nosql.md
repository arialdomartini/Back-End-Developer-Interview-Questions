* What is Eventual Consistency?
* The Brewer's Theorem, most commonly known as the CAP theorem, states that in the presence of a Network Partition (the P in CAP), a system's designer has to choose between Consistency (the C in CAP) and Availability (the A in CAP). Can you think about examples of CP, AP and CA systems?
* How would you explain the recent rise in interest for NoSQL?
* How does NoSQL tackle scalability challenges?
* In which case would you use a document database like MongoDB instead of a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL?
